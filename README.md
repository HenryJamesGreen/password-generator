# Password-generator

## A tool to generate randomised passwords for a user.

This project can be used as a tool to generate a random password for the user, using a series of confirm windows and a button. The generator requires:

- Specification of number of characters (10-64).
- Specification of what kind of characters to use (special, numeric, uppercase and lowercase).

The end result (a randomised password generated within above mentioned parameters) is then created by the click of a button.
